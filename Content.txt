VW UP

The Up may be the smallest car on offer in the Volkswagen range, but it doesn’t miss out on all the hallmarks that the marque is renowned for. 
It may not be revolutionary in the segment, but the Up beats its closest rivals on finish, refinement, desirability and economy.

Add in the facts you can get the punchy, 89bhp 1.0 TSI engine at the front and that a sporty Up GTI due to join the range imminently, it is the small car that can cater for everyone’s needs.

Skoda Citigo

The cheapest member of the Volkswagen Group triumvirate, but don’t think for one moment that it lets the side down. 
Yes, it is plainer and less well equipped than its siblings, in order to fulfill that lower price point, but the Citigo is a typical Skoda, 
which means it is extremely well finished and involving to drive.

A recent facelift has helped lift the sense of quality to make it a more enticing proposition.

Suzuki Celerio
The budget Suzuki makes no qualms about what it is – a no-nonsense option, and it’s very likeable because of it.

The Celerio may lack the panache and sense of occasion that some of the more premium city cars will offer in abundance, 
but it more than makes up for that lack of inspiration by doing all the basic things well, including being pleasing to drive and easy to get comfortable in. 
What more could you ask for from a small car?

Mercedes-Benz S Class

When Mercedes-Benz sets out to make a new S-Class, the brief is to make the best car in the world. While it might not seduce like a Jaguar XJ, that’s not what it’s for.

This car does what it’s supposed to do superbly and is functionally exceptional. 
It was conceived as a long-wheelbase saloon, giving it unprecedented torsional rigidity, and the ride is helped by standard air suspension with adaptive dampers.

There’s a choice of three petrol and one diesel engine, with standard cars sing a 9G-Tonic Plus nine-speed automatic ‘box.

The S-Class is engineered to happen quietly and comfortably, it could hardly ride better, and it steers directly and precisely.

The interior is spacious and supremely comfortable, and festooned with technology, including a 12.3in screen and Mercedes’ Comand Online system as standard.

Tesla Model S

The first bespoke creation from electric car pioneer Elon Musk’s firm, the Model S is the machine that brought credibility, luxury and useful range to the electric car market.

There are four battery options, topped by a 100kWh pack with a credible 393-mile range from the 415bhp electric motor. 
It can take off with the ferocity of a super saloon, but more wonderful is how precisely and effortlessly you can meter out its pace.

The Model S delivers a hugely credible steer, a large, quiet, premium cabin and massive load space, with a futuristic feel. For a select niche, it will make financial as well as environmental sense. 

As a comfortable ride, it challenges the likes of the Rolls-Royce Phantom and Bentley Mulsanne. 
Where the S-Class leads, the rest of the car-making world follows.

Audi A8

he latest A8 feature a more advanced chassis, powertrain and in-car technology than the Mercedes S-Class including, when it’s switched on, the greatest capability for autonomous driving of any production car in the world.

There’s a choice of turbocharged engines – a 282bhp diesel or 335bhp petrol – with four-wheel-drive as standard and a 48V electrical system that gives it mild hybrid status.

The quality interior feels like it was built to outlast civilization itself, although it lacks the elegance of the S-Class. 
The ride is smooth and it’s easy to drive, although it puts up with being hustled rather than revelling in it.

Porsche 911 Carrera

We’ve been here before. The 911 is improved beyond question. It’s easier to live with than before and superior to drive, for the most part. 
It’s all the good bits of the first generation 991 tweaked and enhanced. Then there’s the significant bit, which, as usual, will upset the purists.

If you’d never driven a naturally aspirated 911, the arrival of a turbocharged Carrera wouldn’t be a big deal. Two things to note, though. 
First, like moving to water cooling and electric steering, it’s inevitable and we’ll get used to it. Second, this is still a good engine and it’s in the best sports car.

Nissan GT-R

However long in the tooth it has become, Godzilla is in rude health. If speed is what you want, nothing does it better below L100k.  But then speed probably isn’t all you want in a modern sports car. Nissan knows this.

It has tried to make the GT-R a more rounded, luxurious and mature axe-wielding mentalist of a device – and it has made a difference, albeit not a big one.

Delicacy isn’t this car’s forte any more now than it was before but, compared with the increasingly digital-feeling cars launched around and about it, the GT-R offers more charm than ever.

Chevrolet Corvette Stingray
If you were asked to predict what the Corvette Stingray would be like based purely on its on-paper specification and how it looks, our bet is that you would not be wide of the mark. It’s a large, old-school supercar with a brawny naturally aspirated engine, a manual gearbox and rear-wheel drive.

Sounds very traditional, and it is, to an extent, but it comes with an interior which, while not causing sleepless nights in much of Germany, is a quantum leap over that of the model it replaces.

There’s plenty of ability here, and it is greatly enjoyable if you can find the right places to deploy it.
